#### Project Name: Cloth Simulator using particle-system
![PREVIEW](https://goo.gl/SK9M30)

#### Description:
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloth simulator using particle based system. This simulator allows manipulation on the cloth type ( soft/rigid ),
gravity (up/down), and wind speed. Some custom object properties are also available. This simulation is inspired by [Jesper Mosegaard](https://alexandra.dk/dk/om_os/medarbejdere/jesper-mosegaard)'s
approach however tweaked to further simulate it and also to add enhancement on performance and UI.

#### Dependencies:
    * opengl
    * glut - for windowing
    * glui - for ui toolkit
    * soil - (optional) for image texturing support
